<h2> About this project </h2>

<p>
A.Write a data structure (RuleSet) for expressing these rules between options, ie. for defining a rule set. You also need to define a constructor and 2 methods:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>NewRuleSet(): Returns an empty rule set.</li>
  <li>RuleSet.AddDep(A, B): a method for rule sets that adds a new dependency A between and B.</li>
  <li>RuleSet.AddConflict(A, B): a method for rule sets that add a new conflict between A and B.</li>
</ul>

<p>
B. Implement the algorithm that checks that an instance of that data structure is coherent, that is, that no option can depend, directly or indirectly, on another option and also be mutually exclusive with it.
RuleSet.IsCoherent(): a method for rule sets that returns true if it is a coherent rule set, false otherwise.
</p>
